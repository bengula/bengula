# Bengula Keith Jacob

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a **Data Scientist** and **Economist** currently working on becoming a **DevOps Engineer**. I'm passionate about solving complex problems using data-driven approaches and automation. My journey into DevOps has been fueled by a desire to streamline processes, enhance system reliability, and optimize performance. I'm also actively learning **Linux** as part of my DevOps toolkit.

## âš¡ Fun fact: ...

When I'm not diving into DevOps or data science, I enjoy exploring new recipes in the kitchen. I'm also fascinated by the potential  of philosophy. Math is the epitome of philosophy merging science and arts. 
<span class="latex"> \LaTeX </span>

**My philosophy is:** ** _<span style="color:blue;">Change is the only constant</span>_, which can be expressed mathematically as:

![Delta k does not equal zero](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta%20k%20%5Cneq%200)

Therefore, I keep learning.
